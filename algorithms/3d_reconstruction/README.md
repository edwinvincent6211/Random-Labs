## Updates
- 19/12/19: For higher amount of pairs of images, the geometry modelling will be being over complicated, so a raw data driven technique to solve this inverse problem is more preferred like using openai lab to generate virtual data and use neutral networks to learn the feature filters and the inverse model.

## Remarks
- This note is extracted from many 3D computer vision theories, most of them are ref. from
